# Delay_Classification

Using this expert evaluation methodology you can quantify cloud games based on their delay sensitivity.

There are 9 characteristics that need to be evaluated!

These 9 characteristics are presented in the following link:

Furthermore, the repo consists of the methodology for quantifying new games, which you can demonstrate it with 30 sample video games in [study demonstration](https://sssabet.github.io/Delay_Classification/study) page. 
For that do the following steps:
1. Add videos of the game in the Game folder.
2. In the study.html file, add the number of new games that you want to evaluate
'var nGames = "";'
3. Update the condition plan for the randomization of the test participants.
4. Run the study.html



The repository also contains the dataset and some parts of the data that we used for the evaluation of the model.
